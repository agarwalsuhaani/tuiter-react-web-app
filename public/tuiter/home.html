    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br>
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type <br>
        specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic<br>
        typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the<br>
        release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,<br>
        and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
        versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
